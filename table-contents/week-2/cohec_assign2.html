			<h4>What is the purpose of the website?</h4>
			<p>What I am hoping to get from building this website is to create a strong web portfolio that shows not only the final product but some of the process of what goes into some of the things I’ve created. This would mostly apply to my digital work but might be interesting to play around with when it comes to the written work.</p>
			<h4>Who is the intended audience?</h4>
			<p>Most likely potential employers and/or teachers. I hope to create this space to put old work as well as show my design process.</p>
			<h4>What tone do you want for the site’s written content?</h4>
			<p>I think it will live in a space in between formal and slightly conversational since I want it to show my personality. In this sense it will contain my resume as a point of reference for future employers while maintaining a strong sense of my personality.</p>

			<h4>What will be the primary content of your site?</h4>
			<p>I’ve been looking the site <a href="http://www.xxix.com">XXIX</a> for a lot of inspiration and I’m interested in playing a bit off this idea. Particularly I’m interested in adding interactivity for the home page while keeping it not too overwhelming. I’m particularly hoping to make it look like a series of minimal folder digitized—I’m thinking it will have a slightly early internet look.</p>

			<h4>What will be the secondary content?</h4>
			<p>The secondary content will be the about me, resume, as well as a page on how the website was created—I’m hoping to do this to illustrate how I work to create something to employers as well as a point of reference for myself.<p>

			<h4>How will users navigate through your site?</h4>
			<p>There will most likely be a top navigation bar as well as through some minor clicks and scrolls. The site map below illustrates this fairly accurately.</p>
